              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Adrian Chambers. I am a computer science student and I am currently doing an online bootcamp course for web development.
                I already have decent experience with HTML and CSS but I'd like to go through the entire course without skipping through it because I might learn something that I previously missed or forgot about.
                I might also discover a more efficient way to organize my code.
