    <p>
      My name is Adrian Chambers. I am a computer science student and I am currently doing an online bootcamp course for web development.
      I am at the beginning of the course right now, starting with the HTML section.
      I already have decent experience with HTML and CSS but I'd like to go through the entire course without skipping through it because I might learn something that I previously missed or forgot about.
      I might also discover a more efficient way to organize my code.
